# bubble-sort


    Pseudo Code

    End Goal = All numbers in array sorted in numeric value from lowest to highest.

    Step 1:
    Take two elements from array at a time and determine which one is greater. 
    - Place lower value to lowest index value of the two. "Swap if you will".
    
    Step 2:
    Out of two elements, increase index of the first and second number by 1.
    - This moves us to the next pair of numbers to sort 
    - While still comparing the highest index of the last pair
    
    Step 3:
    Repeat step 2 through the length of the array.
    
    Step 4:
    If you run through the entire array without swapping any number positions stop.
